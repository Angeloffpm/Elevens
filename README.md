# Activity 8

One more final question-centric activity before you write the code. This one is important, because it gives a great example of how Inheritance can be used to avoid writing similar code in multiple places, and why Abstract classes are useful. Don't breeze through this one; there is a lot of information, but it is important to understand the structure of the solution you will be asked to write or the later activities will not go well.
